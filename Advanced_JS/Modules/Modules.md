# Modules

## A module is a function or group of similar functions. They are grouped or together within a file and contain the code to execute a specific task when called into a larger application.
### Basically, modules allow us to break up our code into separate files.  

Note: We have to write type = "module" in script tag of any html file. Otherwise we module cannot be created.
